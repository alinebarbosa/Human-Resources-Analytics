# Human-Resources-Analytics

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set

## Codebook
You can retrieve a copy of the current v13 codebook here: http://rpubs.com/rhuebner/HRCodebook-13.
I highly recommend checking it out to assist you in understanding the data set. When you do, use the "v13" of the file; which is the newest version.

## Context
HR data can be hard to come by, and HR professionals generally lag concerning analytics and data visualization competency. Thus, Dr Carla Patalano and Dr Rich Huebner set out to create this HR-related dataset, which is used in one of our graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of Business. They created this data set themselves. They use the data set to teach HR students how to use and analyze the data in Tableau Desktop - a data visualization tool that's easy to learn.

## Content
They have reduced the complexity of the dataset down to a single data file (v13). The CSV revolves around a fictitious company, called Dental Magic, and the core data set contains names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score.

## Acknowledgements
Dr Carla Patalano provided the baseline idea for creating this synthetic data set, which has been used now by over 100 Human Resource Management students at the college. Students in the course learn data visualization techniques with Tableau Desktop and use this data set to complete a series of assignments.

## Objective:
Analyse the data to find some insights and answer:
- The HR manager needs to identify the relationships between the performance of its employees and who leads them. 
- What is the general profile of the organization? 
- What are the best sources of recruitment?
